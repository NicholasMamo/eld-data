"""
The Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) package is one of the most important parts of EvenTDT.
This package makes it easier to implement new TDT algorithms or to use existing ones.
It achieves this by providing:

1. Tools to help you implement new algorithms, such as the :class:`~tdt.nutrition.store.NutritionStore`; and
2. A uniform interface for TDT algorithms in :class:`~tdt.algorithms.TDTAlgorithm`.
