"""
Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) approaches are normally accompanied by a summarization module.
Whereas the TDT technique tells us that something happened, summarization explains what happened.

Summarization takes the machine-understandable data and creates human-understandable information.
This package provides :ref:`basic summarization resources <summarization_basics>`, :ref:`algorithms to summarize documents <summarization_algorithms>` and :ref:`functionality to build timelines <summarization_timelines>`.
