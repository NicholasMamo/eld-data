"""
After adding tweets to a :class:`~queues.Queue`, consumers process that data.
Each consumer dequeues the accumulated data and performs some processing on it.

There is one class that is the base of all consumers: the basic :class:`~queues.consumers.Consumer`
From it stem all other consumers, including the :class:`~queues.consumers.buffered_consumer.BufferedConsumer`.

These consumers are meant to be usable with minimal changes.
Although that makes them less flexible than building your own consumer, it also makes it easier to get started with EvenTDT.

Normally, you would either set up a stream using the :class:`~twitter.listeners.TweetListener` or by reading from a file using the :class:`~twitter.file.FileReader`.
These streams store tweets in a :class:`~queue.Queue`â€”the same one that is given to any :class:`~queues.consumers.Consumer` class.
You can then run the :func:`~queues.consumers.Consumer.run` function.
More commonly, if you are not interested in the implementation details, you can run consumers using the :mod:`~tools.consume` command-line tool.

The consumers package is the most central one in EvenTDT because it ties together all other packages.
Apart from some simple consumers, the package includes consumers based on algorithms presented in papers.
These complete solutions can be used as baselines to generate a :class:`~summarization.timeline.Timeline` and later for summarization.
These consumers revolve around a :class:`~tdt.algorithms.TDTAlgorithm` and are meant to be as faithful as possible to the original approaches.

    The abstract :class:`~queues.consumers.Consumer` class outlines the necessary functions of any consumer.
    All consumers follow a simple workflow.
    After being initialized with a :class:`~queues.Queue` that supplies data, the consumer run using the :func:`~queues.consumers.Consumer.run` function.

    Consumers have two other state variables apart from the :class:`~queues.Queue`: the ``active`` and ``stopped`` variables.
    The ``active`` variable indicates whether the consumer is still accepting objects.
    The ``stopped`` variable indicates whether the consumer has finished consuming all objects.
    Generally, consumers keep accepting objects until the ``active`` variable is disabled, at which point they process the last objects and set the ``stopped`` flag to ``True``.

        This is because the :class:`~twitter.file.FileReader` supports skipping tweets, which introduces some latency.
        When skipping a lot of time or lines, this latency can get very large.
        You can use the ``wait`` parameter to delay running the consumer by a few seconds to wait for the :class:`~twitter.file.FileReader` to finish skipping part of the corpus.

        In addition, corpora may be sparse with periods of time during which little data is fed to the consumer.
        This can also happen when the :class:`~twitter.listeners.TweetListener` fails to collect tweets because of errors in the Twitter API.
